## News Summary


The cryptocurrency market is showing significant momentum with Bitcoin surpassing $60,000 amid growing optimism around potential ETF approvals. This price movement represents a critical psychological barrier and could signal renewed institutional interest in the asset class.

Meanwhile, Ethereum's recent network upgrade has successfully reduced gas fees by approximately 30%, addressing one of the main pain points for users and developers. This improvement comes at a crucial time as Layer 2 solutions continue to gain traction, with one new protocol claiming to achieve 100,000 transactions per second while maintaining Ethereum's security guarantees.

On the regulatory front, there are signs of potential progress as an SEC Commissioner has publicly advocated for clearer cryptocurrency regulations. This development coincides with traditional financial institutions expanding their crypto offerings, exemplified by a major global bank launching custody services for institutional clients, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets.
